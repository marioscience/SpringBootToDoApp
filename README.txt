To run application first run server:

Using command line go to project folder (ToDoApp) and run the following:
./mvnw spring-boot:run

This should start the ToDo server listening for requests.

Then run the client.
First navigate to the directory of the client (todoappclient) and run the following:
npm install

then after that is done run:
node run start 

alternatively you can run 'npm start' which is an equivalent command.

The page should open automatically on the browser. If not, try any of the following in your browser:
 http://localhost:3000
http://127.0.0.1:3000 which should bring the app up.

Enjoy!
